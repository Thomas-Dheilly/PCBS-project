The aim of the project is to recreate the experiments presented in the article Stoet and al., 2013, "Are women better than men at multi-tasking ?". 

The original aim of the study is to assess if women are better than men at multi-tasking, with multi-tasking defined in two ways. 
The first definition of multi-tasking is "the skill of being able to deal with multiple task demands without the need to carry out the involved tasks simultaneously", skill that is typically test through a task-switching experimental paradigm. The second definition of multi-tasking proposed in the article is the ability to carry out or process two types of informations simultaneously.

Experiment 1 in the article aims at testing if women are better than men in mutlti tasking according to definition no 1, and the second experiment according to definition no 2. Our aim will be to recreate the experiments of experiment 1 and 2. We cannot replicate the study as we would need to test the experiments on a consequent sample of men and women, that is why we only focus on reacreating the experiments of the article.

More precisly, in experiment 1, we will recreate the shape and filling task that is following the section "Procedures" 
In experiment 2, we will only aim at recreating the calcul task, given that the map task and key task mentioned can hardly be implemented in python.
