The aim of the project is to recreate the experiments presented in the article Berlucchi and al., 1971, "Simple reaction times of  ipsilateral and contralateral hand to lateralized visual stimuli". 

The original aim of the study is to assess if "visuomotor reactions are crucially dependent on a pathway joining the visual cortex to the motor cortex and if the callosal connexions of the visual cortex play a major role in the interhemispheric mediation of crossed
reactions." 

Two hypothesis are thus tested by the authors : -"crossed reactions should be longer than uncrossed ones: the right hand should react faster to stimuli presented in the right visual field and the left hand should react faster to stimuli presented in the left visual field".
-regarding the callosal connections, "one would expect that the difference between crossed and uncrossed reactions should be definitely greater when the stimulus is presented at some distance from the vertical meridian and thus is projected to points in the visual cortex devoid of direct callosal connexions."

To assess the validity of these hypothesis, the authors studied not only the times of crossed and uncrossed reactions, but also tried to find out the precise relationship between the time of interhemispheric transmission and the lateral position of the stimulus pattern in the visual field.

I will aim at recreating the exprimental framework of the study, namely the display of squares of light at different positions on the screen and the associated reaction times to press the button depending on the hand used and the lateral position of the stimuli.
